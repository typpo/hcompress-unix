hcompress
==============

This is a version of hcompress that compiles and works on Ubuntu 12.04 (works on Mac OSX El Capitan as well).

Taken from http://www.stsci.edu/software/hcompress.html, with minor changes.

You can view the original README file, which the authors named `aareadme`.  Or, just run `make all` followed optionally by `make install` to begin using hcompress.
